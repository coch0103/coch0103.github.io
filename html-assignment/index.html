        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I grew up in Stewartville with my two brothers, mom and stepdad. I don’t remember much of my life growing up due to a few concussions and a traumatic brain injury. My dad lived in Carleton Place, I was his only child and I would see him every second weekend. I remember having the best adventures him. We would go camping or I would go to work with him as a carpenter and be his helper. He died when I was 16 of skin cancer.

       <p>I’ve always been a very creative person. I enjoy painting and sewing. I started sewing clothing when I was gifted a sewing machiene on my 17<sup>th</sup> birthday, I can make basic garments and learned to make patterns for my own designs. Now that I’ve moved I will be able to have a sewing room again and will try my hand a dress making. I’ve always loved the early 1900s and 1970s fashion. I think it would be cool to find old sewing patterns from different eras, and revamp them to give them a more modern look while still keeping the original garment in mind.
