          <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I grew up in Stewartville with my two brothers, mom and stepdad. I don't remember much of my life growing up due to a few concussions and a traumatic brain injury. My dad lived in Carleton Place, I was his only child and I would see him every second weekend. I remember having the best adventures with him. He was a carpenter, and I would go to work with him to be his helper. We would also go camping as often as possible. Those are some of the fondest memories I have of him. When I was 16, he passed away after a short battle with skin cancer.

          <p>I've always been a very creative person. I enjoy painting and sewing. I started sewing clothing when I was gifted a sewing machine on my 17th birthday. I can make basic garments, and I’ve learned to make patterns for my own designs. Now that I've moved I will be able to have a sewing room again and will try my hand a dress making. I've always loved the early 1900s and 1970s fashion. I think it would be cool to find old sewing patterns from different eras, and revamp them to give them a more modern look while still keeping the original garment in mind.
